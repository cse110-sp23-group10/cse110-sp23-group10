# Hamza and Bill
Worked on the JavaScript portion of the app after the HTML team was done with Bill. Worked on js_sprint1 branch and implemented Jellybean clicking functionality so that clicking on the jellybean gives a response to the user. Mainly focused on getting fortune telling logic done. By clicking each jellybean, they return a quote in the middle of the screen. Trying to expand on 5 jellybean choosing functionality and trying to make a raffle of all the beans. Pushed branch to github but expect a bit of errors.

Completed HTML files and CSS files for jellybean.html and fortune.html. Building skeleton of the app without much functionality; created animations and graphics for jellybean app. Added the website skeleton to github pages, published onto main branch. Added animations such as jar shaking, music, hovering on jellybeans, and more.
